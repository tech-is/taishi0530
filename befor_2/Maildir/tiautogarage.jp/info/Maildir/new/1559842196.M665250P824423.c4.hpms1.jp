Hi.

I think you will not be happy, because I have a very bad news for you.

Just a few months ago (06/03/2019) I hacked your operating system and I have
full control of your device.
I implanted a small application into your device which sends me your current
IP address and allows me to connect to your device just like remote desktop.
Even if you change your password, it won’t help.

How I infected you?
The router that you used to connect to Internet had a security hole.
You can read about this problem by searching for CVE-2018-10562.
I hacked your router and I put my code into it, and when you tried to
connect to Internet, my program infected your device.

Later I made a full copy of your hard drive (I have all your email contact
lists, list of websites you visited, phone numbers, your passwords etc.)


A little while later, when I was searching your web browsing history I was
shocked by what I saw!!
The sites for adults you are visiting... you know what I mean...

I just want to say - your fantasies are shifted far away from the normal
course!...

For the last 2 months I have been spying on you through your device camera..
especially when you visited those sites to have fun...
Those videos show clearly you having fun and the content for adults you were
watching.. this is pretty nasty and I would be very worried if I were you.

I have secured 4 videos:
Info_tiautogarage_jp_1558833379.mp4 (12.1 MB)
Info_tiautogarage_jp_1555978936.mp4 (94.6 MB)
Info_tiautogarage_jp_1556293445.mp4 (12.8 MB)
Info_tiautogarage_jp_1555704888.mp4 (71.6 MB)

You can verify that the timestamps correspond to the moments you were
enjoying yourself...

Now, because I do not like at all what I saw (that’s pretty crazy and
ugly) I ask you to send me a donation through Bitcoin network.

2000 US dollars is a fair price (considering your perversions).

If you want me to forget about the whole case, remove the files and disable
the nasty app that is spying you, send me the Bitcoin payment within 72
hours. Yes, I give you 72 hours only.

Here is my wallet:

=======================================
Send exactly 0.295397 BTC to my address:

﻿3BMRrHCtAPyLFepU8CxMJGUUn2r7HxCiW6

(copy it and paste - it’s case sensitive)
=======================================
0.295397 BTC = 2000 dollars

If you do not send me the Bitcoin, I promise you - I will send those 4 files
with you enjoying yourself to all your contact lists, associates and social
network friends.

I still have access to your device and I know when you read this message.
When you opened it, time started ticking. You have 72 hours only!

I am from Russia and nobody will help you if you report this email.. Before
they find me your life will be ruined! If you do not cooperate with me - I
will release this ugly material immediately.

This is why I advise you - send me the Bitcoin and let’s forget about the
whole situation. I know you can afford it.

If you do not know how to send bitcoin, go to google and search how to do
it. There are plenty of options like coinbase.

Here is my address again:

=======================================
Send exactly:

0.295397 BTC

to my address:

﻿3BMRrHCtAPyLFepU8CxMJGUUn2r7HxCiW6

=======================================

Remember to send the exact amount as above! This way I will know it’s from
you.

Do not be angry at me. This is just my job, and you are not the only person
I caught.

Be angry at your fantasies - if you didn’t visit those sites for adults
you would have no problem.. but now...

I am waiting for your bitcoin.

Remember, time is ticking..
