Good day dear,

Please permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business
relationship with you. I got your contact from the International web
site directory. I prayed over it and selected your name among other
names due to what my mind told me that you are a reputable and trust
worthy person I can expose my ordeal to and do business with. So I must
not hesitate to confide in you for this simple and sincere business.

I am Raphael Kamara and my younger sister Juliet Kamara, the only son
and daughter of late Mr and Mrs Vincent Kamara. My father was a very
wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast,
before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of
their outing to discus on a business deal.

When my mother died on the 6th October 2016, my father took me special
because I am the only son and my younger sister Juliet, we are
motherless then, before the death of my father on 30th August 2018 in a
private hospital here in Abidjan, he secretly called me on his bedside
and told me that he has a sum of $7.500.000 (seven million, five hundred
thousand US dollars) left in a suspense account in a local Bank here in
Abidjan, that he used my name as his only son for the next of kin in
deposit of the fund. He explained to me that it was because of this
wealth and some huge amount of money his business associates supposed to
balance him from the deal they had, that he was poisoned by his business
associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a
country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for
investment purpose, (such as real estate management).

Please, I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.
1) To receive the money for me in your account by providing a Bank
account where this money would be transferred to.
2) To serve as the guardian of this since I am a boy of 19 years and I
do not have business experience.
3) To help me come over to your country as soon as the money is
transferred to your account so that we will continue our education and
a new life.

I am willing to give you 20% of the sum as compensation for effort input
after the successful transfer of this fund to your designate
account overseas. Anticipating to hear from you quick please. Thanks and
God Bless.

yours faithfully
Raphael and Juliet
