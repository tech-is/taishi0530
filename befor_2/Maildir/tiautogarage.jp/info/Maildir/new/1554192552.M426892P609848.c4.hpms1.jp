Good day dear,

With due respect and heart full of tears we write this letter to solicit
your help in migrating to your country, My name is Kenneth Williams and my
younger sister Juliet, we are the children of Late General Alexander
Williams the former Director of military intelligence and special acting
General Manager of the Sierra Leone Diamond mining operation(SLDMC ). I am
contacting you to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest USD18
million belonging to my late father which is deposited in a bank in
Abidjan. This money is revenues from solid minerals and diamonds sale
which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out.

Following the brake out of the war, almost all government offices,
cooperation’s and prostates were attacked and vandalized. The SLDMC was
looted and burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of dollars was
stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. Many
top government officials and senior army officers were assassinated and my
father was a key target because of his very sensitive military position
and appointment in the SLDMC. Regrettably, my father was captured and
murdered along with half brother in cool blood during a mid-night rebel
shoot-out when our official residence in Freetown was ambushed by Forday
Sanko the notorious rebel leader. My mother sustained very sever bullet
injuries which resulted to her untimely and painful death in a private
hospital here in Ivory Coast.

Now we are alone in a totally strange country without parents, relatives
or any body to care for us at our tender ages. Before our mother died, she
told us that our father deposited some money which he made from diamond
sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that we should
pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help us to
transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas.
She told us to do this quickly so that we can leave Ivory Coast with our
cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp with us and, then settle
down abroad. She gave us all the bank documents to prove the deposit and
then told us that my father used my name as the only son to deposit the
money in the bank. She told us that this is the reason why we came to
Ivory Coast. My mother died afterwards. May her spirit rest in perfect
peace. I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this money and I
spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that
the everything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my
foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide my partners foreign
bank account for them. However, the director is very concerned because of
my age, I am 17 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to
speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only
profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for me.

Please note that I can only offer you 15% of the total money as
compensation for your noble assistance in accordance with my mothers
advise. I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you
consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me,
my little sister and cousin so that we can finish our college education. I
shall give you more details when I receive your urgent response.

Thanks, and God bless you, give you the wisdom to carry out this great
deal. Awaiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss the
modalities of this transaction.

I await your immediate response.
Yours sincerely.
Kenneth & Juliet Williams
